NLP Fundamentals

This project was focused on pulling crypto currency news articles from NewsAPI and applying natural language processing to understand sentiments in the news.

NLP techniques were applied in order to demonstrate these sentiments in an easy to read fashion for the user.

3 main techniques were performed.  Sentiment analysis, NLP identifiers and NER.

When the reader engages in this project you will find various visualizations such as word clouds and dataframes that show summarizations in the news.
